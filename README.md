## Key Features Implementation

### Movie Search

The application uses the TMDB API to search for movies. Search results are debounced to avoid excessive API calls.

### Trending Movies

Popular searches are stored in Appwrite and displayed on the home page. Each search query is counted, and the most frequent searches are shown.

### Movie Filtering

Users can filter movies by:

- Genre (Action, Drama, Comedy, etc.)
- Release year
- Various sorting options (popularity, rating, release date, title)

### Favorites

Movie favorites are stored in the browser's localStorage, allowing users to maintain a list of their preferred movies across sessions.
